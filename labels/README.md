#### Issue Labels

This folder contains a json file that manages the issue labels for the revoltchat organization.

It is applied to our repos via [github-labels](https://github.com/popomore/github-labels).

```bash
# Install github-labels
$ yarn global add github-labels

# Apply labels, this assumes you have 2FA on
$ PAT=abc ./apply.sh
```
